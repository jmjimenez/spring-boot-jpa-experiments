# IMPORTANT: All guidelines must start with # or they will be ignored as comments

# Project Guidelines:
# This is a Spring Boot project with JPA
# Use Spring Boot best practices
# The project uses Java 21 - use the most advanced features when possible
# The project uses Maven for dependency management
# Include unit tests and integration tests when possible, differentiate them by name
# Use hexagonal architecture guidelines, splitting domain, infrastructure and application layers
# If any questions are not correct, don't hesitate to correct or ask for additional information

# CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES:
# ALWAYS verify dependency compatibility before making claims - check official documentation, GitHub issues, and release notes
# NEVER assume compatibility issues without proper research - use official sources and recent information
# When dealing with version conflicts, check the latest releases and official compatibility matrices
# For Spring Boot compatibility issues, verify against the official Spring Boot compatibility matrix
# For third-party libraries, check their GitHub issues, releases, and official documentation
# If unsure about compatibility, say "I need to research this" rather than making assumptions
# Always provide sources when making compatibility claims
# When suggesting dependency changes, verify the change works before recommending it 

# CODE CHANGE PRACTICES:
# ONLY make changes that directly support the requested feature or fix
# NEVER refactor unrelated code unless explicitly requested
# PRESERVE existing formatting, indentation, and line breaks exactly as they are
# DON'T "clean up" or "improve" code that wasn't part of the request
# FOCUS on minimal, atomic changes that achieve the specific goal
# AVOID changing import ordering, spacing, or formatting unless necessary for the feature
# KEEP commits and changes focused on a single concern
# DON'T introduce "while I was here" improvements or formatting changes
