Before making any claim about test behavior:
- Have I read the complete test output/log?
- Have I identified all test executions in the log?
- Have I checked for duplicate test runs?
- Have I verified the Maven configuration?
- Am I basing conclusions on evidence or assumptions?
- Have I looked for test suite executions?
- Have I counted how many times each test appears?
