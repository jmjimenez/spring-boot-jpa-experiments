ALWAYS verify dependency compatibility before making claims - check official documentation, GitHub issues, and release notes
NEVER assume compatibility issues without proper research - use official sources and recent information
When dealing with version conflicts, check the latest releases and official compatibility matrices
For Spring Boot compatibility issues, verify against the official Spring Boot compatibility matrix
For third-party libraries, check their GitHub issues, releases, and official documentation
If unsure about compatibility, say "I need to research this" rather than making assumptions
Always provide sources when making compatibility claims
When suggesting dependency changes, verify the change works before recommending it
