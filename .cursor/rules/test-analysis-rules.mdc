When analyzing test failures or logs:
1. ALWAYS read the complete test log/output provided by user
2. Look for patterns of test execution (which tests run, how many times)
3. Identify actual error messages and stack traces
4. Check for duplicate test executions or suite runs
5. Verify test configuration and Maven profiles
6. NEVER assume test behavior without examining evidence
7. If user provides test.log, analyze it line by line for patterns
8. Look for test suite executions in logs (IntegrationTestSuite, UnitTestSuite)
9. Count how many times each test class appears in the log
10. Verify Maven profile configurations match actual test execution
